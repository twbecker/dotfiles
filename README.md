# README
These are my dotfiles.  There are many like them but these are mine.

## Contents
I'm just getting started getting these organized.  But so far it installs and configures 
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and a number of Vim plugins 
via submodules (gasp!).

## Installation
Installation should go something like this:
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/twbecker/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
* cd ~/.dotfiles; ./bootstrap
